The `RecurringPayments` contract implements recurring payments and subscriptions on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) using ERC20's approval and timelocked proxy of transferFrom() to handle recurring payments that can be cancelled anytime.

Here's a description of the functions in the contract:

`createSubscription`: This function creates a new subscription for the specified customer. It takes in the payee address to send subscription payments to, the cost of the subscription, the token used to pay for the subscription, the IPFS hash of external data, and the unique identifier of the subscription. The function checks whether an active subscription already exists for the customer and creates a new subscription with the given parameters if not. The subscription information is stored in the subscriptions mapping with a hash of the customer's address and the unique identifier of the subscription. Finally, the function transfers the subscription cost from the customer to the payee and emits a NewSubscription event with the IPFS hash and the subscription ID as parameters.

`cancelSubscription`: This function cancels an existing subscription for a customer. It takes in the token used to pay for the subscription, the payee address to send subscription payments to, the cost of the subscription, the subscription period, and the IPFS hash of external data. The function calculates the subscription ID based on the given parameters and sets the subscription time to zero in the subscriptions mapping. It emits a SubscriptionCancelled event to notify the cancellation.

`executePayment` is a function in the RecurringPayments smart contract that executes a payment for a customer's subscription. It takes in the customer's address, the token used to pay for the subscription, the payee address to send the payment to, the cost of the subscription, the subscription period, the gas fee for the transaction, and the IPFS hash of external data. The function checks if the customer has an active subscription, and if the elapsed time since the last payment is greater than the subscription period plus a preprocessing window. If the subscription is active and the elapsed time meets the conditions, the function transfers the subscription cost minus the payee fee to the payee's address and transfers the payee fee to a gas proxy address. Finally, the function updates the subscription timestamp in the subscriptions mapping and emits a SubscriptionPaid event.

`batchExecutePayment`: This function executes a batch of subscription payments. It takes in an array of PaymentData structs that contain the input parameters of the executePayment function for each subscription. The function iterates through the array and calls the executePayment function for each subscription.

`encodeSubscriptionId`: This function generates a unique subscription ID based on the given parameters. It takes in the token address, the payee address, the subscription cost, the subscription period, and the IPFS hash of external metadata. The function creates a unique ID for the subscription by hashing the inputs using the keccak256 hash function. This ID will be used to identify the subscription in the subscriptions mapping.

`getSubscriptionTimestamp`: This function retrieves the timestamp of the last payment for a subscription. It takes in the customer address and the subscription ID and returns the subscription time stored in the subscriptions mapping.
