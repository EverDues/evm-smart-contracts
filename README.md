The `RecurringPayments` contract implements recurring payments and subscriptions on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) using ERC20's approval and timelocked proxy of transferFrom() to handle recurring payments that can be cancelled anytime.

Here's a description of the functions in the contract:

`createSubscription`: This function creates a new subscription for the specified customer. It takes in the payee address to send subscription payments to, the cost of the subscription, the token used to pay for the subscription, the IPFS hash of external data, and the unique identifier of the subscription. The function checks whether an active subscription already exists for the customer and creates a new subscription with the given parameters if not. The subscription information is stored in the subscriptions mapping with a hash of the customer's address and the unique identifier of the subscription. Finally, the function transfers the subscription cost from the customer to the payee and emits a NewSubscription event with the IPFS hash and the subscription ID as parameters.

`cancelSubscription`: This function cancels an existing subscription for a customer. It takes in the token used to pay for the subscription, the payee address to send subscription payments to, the cost of the subscription, the subscription period, and the IPFS hash of external data. The function calculates the subscription ID based on the given parameters and sets the subscription time to zero in the subscriptions mapping. It emits a SubscriptionCancelled event to notify the cancellation.

`executePayment`: This function executes a subscription payment for a customer. It takes in the customer address to send subscription payments from, the token used to pay for the subscription, the payee address to send subscription payments to, the cost of the subscription, the subscription period, and the IPFS hash of external data. The function retrieves the subscription time from the subscriptions mapping using the hash of the customer's address and the subscription ID. It then checks whether the subscription exists and the subscription period is not zero. The function calculates the elapsed time since the last payment and the preprocessing window based on the subscription period. It verifies that the elapsed time is greater than the preprocessing window to proceed with the payment. The function calculates the new subscription time based on the elapsed time and the subscription period and updates the subscriptions mapping accordingly. Finally, the function transfers the subscription cost from the customer to the payee and emits a SubscriptionPaid event.

`batchExecutePayment`: This function executes a batch of subscription payments. It takes in an array of PaymentData structs that contain the input parameters of the executePayment function for each subscription. The function iterates through the array and calls the executePayment function for each subscription.

`encodeSubscriptionId`: This function generates a unique subscription ID based on the given parameters. It takes in the token address, the payee address, the subscription cost, the subscription period, and the IPFS hash of external metadata. The function creates a unique ID for the subscription by hashing the inputs using the keccak256 hash function. This ID will be used to identify the subscription in the subscriptions mapping.

`getSubscriptionTimestamp`: This function retrieves the timestamp of the last payment for a subscription. It takes in the customer address and the subscription ID and returns the subscription time stored in the subscriptions mapping.
